Description: Japanese character screensaver for KDE
 Kannasaver is a screensaver that displays random characters from the
 Japanese syllabary, ideally causing them to stick in your memory after
 you have viewed them a number of times. Kannasaver can be configured to
 display basic, extended, and compound characters from hiragana, katakana,
 or both simultaneously.
